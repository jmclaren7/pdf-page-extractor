# PDF Page Extractor
A GUI to quickly extract pages from PDF files using a string of comma separated pages and ranges (eg: 2,7,9-14,22). 

This feature isn't available in Adobe Acrobat and for large PDF files it can be difficult to visually select the pages you want to extract. If you have Acrobat Pro you can use javascript with the "guided actions" feature to do the same thing, you can find the needed code here: https://github.com/jmclaren7/misc/blob/master/acrobat-page-extract.js
